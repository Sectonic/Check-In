# Check-In Preview

*Dashboard Images/Videos are included*

Check-In is an automated attendance management system designed to simplify tracking attendance. With QR codes and unique IDs, Check-In makes attendance tracking quick and easy. This system is perfect for events where efficiency and accuracy are crucial.

## How it works

<img src='/preview/Check-In Diagram.svg' alt='Tree Diagram' style={{ height: 325, margin: 'auto' }} />

#### **1. Meets**
    - Organizer accounts create meets as the primary group that events fall under. For example, a classroom can be a meet, and each day of class can be an event. Meets are highly customizable.

#### **2. Attendees**
    - The individuals who will attend the events. They are holistically tied to the organizer but specifically to individual meets.

#### **3. Events**
    - The specific occurrences under a meet. Events are where attendance is tracked.

#### **4. Attendances**
    - The records of who attended which event. This can be done through QR codes, unique IDs, or manually as an organizer.

#### **Multiple ways to collect:**

When scanned or entered, the system automatically identifies the meet and the current event, logging the attendance accordingly. If there are multiple events going on simultaneously, it will prompt you to choose one.
